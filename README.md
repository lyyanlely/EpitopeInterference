# EpitopeInterference

This is the repo to open source the code and data generated for the research work on "Shaping polyclonal responses via antigen-mediated antibody interference".

Codes used in the research are included in the `Scripts`, including 

* `BCell2spec.m`: (MATLAB) Clonal expansion simulations of 2 B cell types with tunable interferences.
* `BCellnp1.m`: (MATLAB) Clonal expansion simulations of `n` high reproduction B cell types plus 1 low reproduction B cell type with tunable interferences.
* `BCell.m`: (MATLAB) Clonal expansion simulations of `n` B cell types including both high reproduction types and low reproduction types with a tunable ratio and random interferences with tunable mean, variance, and asymmetry.
* `popdyn.nb`: (Mathematica) Formal analysis of `n` species clonal expansions with random interferences.

Data generated by the codes are included in the `Data`, including

* `*.fig`: (MATLAB figure) Data used to generate figures in the paper.
* `*.mat`: (MATLAB data) Data of cross competition inference matrices grabed from literature.
